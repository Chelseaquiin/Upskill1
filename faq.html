Sure! Here's an example of how you could structure a simple HTML page with questions and answers using semantic HTML elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>FAQ</title>
    
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>FAQ</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <article>
                <div class="question">Q: What is HTML?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page using a variety of tags and attributes.</div>
            </article>
            <article>
                <div class="question">Q: What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introducing new features and improvements such as native support for multimedia elements (like `<video>` and `<audio>`), new semantic elements (like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, etc.), and improved support for mobile devices.</div>
            </article>
            <article>
                <div class="question">Q: What are semantic HTML elements?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Semantic HTML elements provide meaning and structure to the content of a web page. They convey the purpose or role of the content to both browsers and developers, improving accessibility, SEO, and document structure.

            </article>
